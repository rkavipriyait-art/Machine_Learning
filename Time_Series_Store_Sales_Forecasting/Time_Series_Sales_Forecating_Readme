Sales Forecasting & Fraud Detection using SARIMA

Project Overview
This project implements a Time Series Sales Forecasting and Fraud Detection System using the SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model.

It performs:
-> Sales trend & seasonality analysis
-> Stationarity testing using ADF
-> Sales forecasting using SARIMA
-> Category-wise forecasting
-> Revenue growth analysis (MoM, YoY, CAGR)
-> Residual-based fraud detection

The system uses daily aggregated sales data and applies statistical modeling techniques to forecast future sales and detect anomalies.

Dataset : stores_sales_forecasting.csv

Expected Columns:
Order Date
Sales
Category (optional but required for category forecasting)

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Statsmodels (SARIMAX)
Scikit-learn

Workflow:

1️. Data Preprocessing:
Convert Order Date to datetime
Sort chronologically
Set as index
Resample to daily frequency
Fill missing dates with 0
daily_sales = df['Sales'].resample('D').sum().asfreq('D').fillna(0)

2. Trend & Seasonality Analysis:
Seasonal decomposition (30-day period)
Monthly sales visualization

3. Stationarity Check
Uses Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
Interpretation:
p-value < 0.05 → Stationary
No non-seasonal differencing required

4. Sales Forecasting (SARIMA)
Model used:
order=(1,0,1)
seasonal_order=(1,0,1,30)
80% Train
20% Test
Confidence intervals plotted

Evaluation Metrics:
RMSE
MAE
MAPE

5️. Category-wise Forecasting:
For each unique Category:
Resample daily
Train SARIMA
Print RMSE

6️. Revenue Growth Analysis:
Month-over-Month (MoM)
monthly_revenue.pct_change() * 100
Year-over-Year (YoY)
CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

7️. Residual-Based Fraud Detection:
Fraud detection is implemented using:
Fit SARIMA on full dataset
Extract residuals
Standardize residuals (Z-score)

Flag anomalies where:
|z_score| > 3

These extreme deviations indicate suspicious sales spikes or drops.
Fraud dates are highlighted in the plot.

Output:
The system generates:
Seasonal decomposition plot
Monthly trend plot
Forecast vs Actual plot
Revenue growth visualization
Fraud detection visualization
RMSE / MAE / MAPE metrics
Fraud date list

Why SARIMA?
SARIMA is chosen because:
Handles seasonality (30-day cycle)
Works well with stationary series
Provides confidence intervals
Produces interpretable residuals (useful for fraud detection)

If ADF p-value > 0.05, non-seasonal differencing (d=1) may be required.
Fraud detection uses statistical deviation, not ML classification.
Zero sales days may impact MAPE (division by zero).
