Skewness
0 → Right-skewed distribution
< 0 → Left-skewed distribution
≈ 0 → Symmetrical

Kurtosis
0 → Heavy tails
< 0 → Light tails
≈ 0 → Normal distribution

Inferential statistics:
Inferential statistics is used to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.

Independent T-Test
Compares total_score between:
High Attendance Group
Low Attendance Group
Purpose:
Determine whether attendance significantly affects performance.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Tests whether mean total_score differs across grade categories.
Model Used:
total_score ~ C(grade)
Visualization:
Boxplot by Grade

Pearson Correlation Test
Measures relationship between:
Weekly Self Study Hours
Total Score
Output:
Correlation Coefficient
P-value
Visualization:
Scatter Plot

Predictive Statistical Analysis
Multiple Linear Regression
Predicts total_score using:
Weekly Self Study Hours
Attendance Percentage
Class Participation
Model:
total_score ~ study_hours + attendance + participation
Outputs:
Coefficients
R-squared
P-values
Regression Summary

Notes:
A Z-test is used to test the sample mean when the sample size is large (n > 30) or population variance is known.
A t-test is used to test the sample mean when the sample size is small and population variance is unknown.
A Chi-square test is used to determine whether there is an association between two categorical variables.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of more than two groups.
If the p-value < 0.05, the result is statistically significant; otherwise, it is not significant.

p_value in inferential statistics
p < 0.05 → Significant difference
p ≥ 0.05 → No significant difference

If p-value ≈ 0:
There is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis
You reject the null hypothesis
The result is highly statistically significant

Small p-value → Strong evidence against null hypothesis
Large p-value → Weak evidence against null hypothesis
